/*
Given an array of citations
(each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have
at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers
have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which
means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of
them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3
citations each and the remaining two with no more than
3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the
maximum one is taken as the h-index.
